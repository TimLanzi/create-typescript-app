# Create TypeScript App
Easily bootstrap your TypeScript project with a pre-built boilerplate. This tool was *HEAVILY* inspired by [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) (thank you Vercel	:heart:) and created as a may for me to have an easy way to get started on TypeScript projects.

You can use one of the predefined templates, or open a PR for one that doesn't exist yet. Existing templates include:
- `default`: Express server with Jest, ESLint, CORS middleware, and custom-env
- `prisma`: Default + Prisma
