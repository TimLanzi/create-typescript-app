This is a TypeScript project bootstrapped with `create-typescript-app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000/hello](http://localhost:4000/hello) with your browser to make sure the server is running.

You can start editing the application, and the server will refresh automatically.
