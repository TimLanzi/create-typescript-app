This is a TypeScript project bootstrapped with `create-typescript-app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) with your browser to make sure the server is running. You should be presented with the Apollo Studio.

You can start editing the application, and the server will refresh automatically.

## Using Apollo Server Express
Open your server at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) with your browser to query the sample data.

Read the [Apollo Server documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) for more information. More information about `apollo-server-express` on the [middleware](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware#apollo-server-express) page.
